Content-Based Filtering

Hybrid approach (combining collaborative and content-based recommendations)

Purpose
This system aims to help users find movies they might enjoy based on:

Previous movie interactions

Similar movies based on features (e.g., genres, cast, etc.)

Tech Stack
Python (Programming Language)

Pandas (Data Manipulation)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

NumPy (Numerical Computation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Flask (Web Framework - if integrated with an API)

TMDB API (for movie data)
